In the Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) branch, there are trajectories for 10 patient models. 
Patients 01-05 are full models, with 100 cm leads and an Implantable Pulse Generator (IPG). Note that not all of these models have bilateral leads - some folders only have 1 lead on one side of the patient's head. These come with segmented CT scans of the patient body.
Patients 06-10 are DBS only models, with 40 cm leads and no IPG. These were used with a generic patient body model.

In the Cardiac branch, there are 10 trajectories, 5 35-cm epicardial trajectories, and 5 58-cm endocardial trajectories, along with their associated IPG.
Child Patient models use the Martin Model [1] and contain the body, skull, brain, and heart.

All models are provided as .stp files. All leads come with a lead wire and its assocaited insulation.
