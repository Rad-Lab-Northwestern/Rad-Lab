# Rad-Lab
This is the repository containing files for Dr. Rad's lab and publications. 

We believe in the power of collaboration and transparency, and so we are making our deep brain stimulation and cardiac implant patient models available. 

Within the branches, the files are sorted by publication. If you choose to use any of the models in your projects, please cite the paper that they are associated with. This information can be found in the text file associated with each publication.

We've created lots of models over the years, so thank you for waiting as we continue to prepare our archive so it can be easily used by everyone!
